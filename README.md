# Assigment
Based the `Vagrantfile` and the provisioning scripts available at:
https://github.com/dustnic/dncs-lab the candidate is required to design a functioning network where
any host configured and attached to `router-1` (through `switch` ) can browse a website hosted on
`host-2-c`.

The subnetting needs to be designed to accommodate the following requirement (no need to create
more hosts than the one described in the `vagrantfile`):
- Up to 130 hosts in the same subnet of `host-1-a`
- Up to 25 hosts in the same subnet of `host-1-b`
- Consume as few IP addresses as possible

<a name="Map"></a>
# Network Map
All the device of our Network can be reach using the broadcast address 192.168.168.000 and the subnet mask is 255.255.248.000.
 The Network can also be divide in three Subnetwork.

In the first (A) there are `host-1-a`, `host-1-b`, `switch` and `router-1`; this net is split in two vLan. The vLan with the tag 170 links `router-1` with `host-1-a`; on the other side we have vLan 171 that link `router-1` with `host-1-b`. <br>
The second Subnetwork (B) links the two routers of the topology eachother. <br>
In the last one (C),  the net links `router-2` with `host-2-c`.

<a name="Subnets"></a>
# Descriptions of  subnets
<a name="A"></a>
## Subnet A
Subnet A is  the part of the network in which we can find `router-1`, `switch`, `host-1-a` and `host-1-b`. We split the link between the port eth1 of the router and the port eth1 of the switch in two vLans, so we can use the same physical link to connect two different hosts through the switch.

The VLAN that links `router-1` to `host-1-a` has 24 bit reserved and only 8 bit dedicated to the hosts but its enough for our configuration. Even if we have 2^8 (256) different IP address, we can't use all it. 2 IPs are reserved: the first one (192.168.170.0) is for IP address space (it has all the last 8 bit at zero) and the last one (192.168.170.255) is the broadcast address (it has all the last 8 bit at one). We decided to use the first free IP address for the port eth1 of the host-1-a (192.168.170.1) and the last free for the port eth1.170 of the router (192.168.170.254).
he request for router-1 was to have 130 possibily hosts to use. Using 7 bits for host we would have had only 128 different IPs addresses: they were not enought for our configuration. So we opt to use 8 bit (254 possibile hosts to use).

On the other side the VLAN that link `router-1` to `host-1-b` has 27 bit reserved for the Net and only 5 for the hosts. In this case we need at least 25 different IP addresses and the 2^5 (32) addresses are enough for IP address space, broadcast address and hosts.
The first IP has to be used for IP address space and in our configuration is 192.168.171.224; the second is 192.168.171.225 and we decided to use for port eth1 of `host-1-b`. We used the second-last 192.168.171.254 for eth1.171 of `router-1` and finally we have to use the last IP 192.168.171.255, with all the last 5 bit ad 1 for broadcast addess.

<a name="r1-a"></a>
### Router-1
We added in the file router-1.sh the following lines:
  ```
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip link add link eth1 name eth1.170 type vlan id 170
ip link add link eth1 name eth1.171 type vlan id 171
ip add add 192.168.170.254/24 dev eth1.170
ip add add 192.168.171.254/27 dev eth1.171
ip link set eth1.170 up
ip link set eth1.171 up
   ```
```
ip link set dev eth1 up
```
We need this line to create the port eth1 that is linked to the switch.
```
ip link add link eth1 name eth1.170 type vlan id 170
ip link add link eth1 name eth1.171 type vlan id 171
```
We use these lines to split the port eth1 in two ports (eth1.170 and eth1.171): so VLAN virtually splits the link. We call the two VLANs with the third 8 bits of IP configuration of the link.
```
ip add add 192.168.170.254/24 dev eth1.170
ip add add 192.168.171.254/27 dev eth1.171
```
With this lines we add the address to the two virtual ports.
```
ip link set eth1.170 up
ip link set eth1.171 up
```
Now we can use these lines to 'switch on' the two ports.


#### IP
Router-1 has two different IP address on port eth1.

From the general IP address 192.168.168.0 we decide to use the configuration 192.168.170.0/24 for the first VLAN and the configuration 192.168.171.224/27 for the second VLAN.

We have IP 192.168.170.254 on eth1.170 on the port that link router with host-1-a. This IP is /24 so we can have an IP for all the 130 possible hosts in the net and we can reserved 2 host for the system. For eth1.171 we have the IP 192.168.171.254, this address is /27 so we have 32 IP, but only 30 free, for the hosts and they're enough for our system.    
<a name="h1a-a"></a>
### Host-1-a
We add this lines in the file host-1-a.sh:
  ```
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip add add 192.168.170.1/24 dev eth1
ip route add 192.168.168.0/21 via 192.168.170.254 
  ```
```
ip link set dev eth1 up
```
We add this line to create the port eth1 in the host-1-a.
```
ip add add 192.168.170.1/24 dev eth1
```
We use this line to add an address to the port eth1; now we can use this port to link the host with other device to send and recive packet.
```
ip route add 192.168.168.0/21 via 192.168.170.254
```
This line is used to add the route that a packet has to do. It say that all the packet with address 192.168.168.0/21, so all the packets that have the same 21 bits of this address, have to be send on the link with router-1 at address 192.168.170.254.

#### IP
  Host-1-a has an IP address on port eth1 linked to router-1. It's 192.168.170.1 and it's the first address free in the configuration of the first VLAN. We can use all the other address except the two of the system and the router's address for any other hosts (until 252 hosts). 
<a name="h1b-a"></a>
### Host-1-b
We add the following lines in file docker-1b.sh to link the host-1-b to the Network:
  ```
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip add add 192.168.171.225/27 dev eth1
ip route add 192.168.168.0/21 via 192.168.171.254
   ```
```  
ip link set dev eth1 up
```
We use this line to create the port eth1 of host-1-b. It's necessary to link the host with the Net.
```
ip add add 192.168.171.225/27 dev eth1
```
We add the IP address 192.168.171.225 with this line at host-1-b's port eth1.

```
ip route add 192.168.168.0/21 via 192.168.171.254
```
With this line we add the route that all packets with an address of configuration 192.168.168.0/21 have to do to reach the right destination. All these packets have to travel through port eth1.171 of router that has IP 192.168.171.254.

#### IP
Host-1-b has an IP address at port eth1. It's 192.168.171.225. With this address and the port eth1 the host can send packets to all the devices with an IP between 192.168.168.0 and 192.168.175.255 and also recived from these devices. All the packets have to pass through port eth1.171 of router-1 at IP address 192.168.171.254.
<a name="s-a"></a>
### Switch
We add these lines in the file switch.sh to link switch with host-1-a, host-1-b and router-1:
  ```
ovs-vsctl add-br switch
ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth1
ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth2 tag=170
ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth3 tag=171
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip link set dev eth3 up
ip link set ovs-system up
```
The  ovs-vsctl  program  supports  the model of a bridge implemented by Open vSwitch (OVS). OVS simulates a Layer 2 learning switch which maintains a MAC address learning table. VMs connect to virtual ports on the switch. We uses the OpenFlow protocol to configure and communicate with Open vSwitch.
 ```
ovs-vsctl add-br switch
  ```
We need this line to configure the switch and use it like a bridge that connect hosts and router because we use multiple ports and VLANs.
```
ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth1
ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth2 tag=170
ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth3 tag=171
```
These lines add the port to the switch and give a different name to all the port. The port has no tag so it's a trunk port instead the other two ports, eth2 and eth3, are tagged with rispectively 170 and 171. These tags are necessary to divided the traffic from router-1, that came in in eth1, to host-1-a's VLAN in eth2 or to host-1-b's VLAN through eth3. The switch read the tag that router assigned to each packet before send it in eth1.
```
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip link set dev eth3 up
```
These lines need to create and switch on the three port eth1, eth2 and eth3 that connect switch with the other devices. Now we can send packets thought switch.

<a name="B"></a>
## Subnet B
We'll call Subnet B the part of our Network that connect the two routers, router-1 and router-2. This link is necessary to connect the hosts in the Subnet A to the hosts in the Subnet C, so all the devices of our Net can send and recived packets for all the other devices.

This link has only to connect the two routers, so we decided to use as less bit for hosts as possible. We can't reserved only 1 bit, two addresses to it, because we need 2 address for the routers, one for the address space and one for the broadcast. So we have to use at least 2 bits for hosts' address, and we decided to use exactly 2 bit for have 4 IP address. <br>
We use 192.168.173.0 for the address space, for the broadcast address we have to use the IP with the last 2 bits at one and in our configuration it's 192.168.173.3. We add IP 192.168.173.1 at eth2 of router-1 and the last IP 192.168.173.2 is the address of eth2 of router-2.
<a name="r1-b"></a>
### Router-1
We add these lines to the file router-1.sh to link the two routers:
```
apt-get install -y frr --assume-yes --force-yes
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip add add 192.168.173.1/30 dev eth2
ip link set eth2 up
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sed -i "s/\(zebra *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
sed -i "s/\(ospfd *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
service frr restart
vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'router ospf' -c 'redistribute connected'  -c 'exit' -c 'interface eth2' -c 'ip ospf area 0.0.0.0' -c 'exit' -c 'exit' -c 'write'
```

```
apt-get install -y frr --assume-yes --force-yes
```
This line is necessary to install in the router the FRRouting protocol that allows a dynamic routing between the routers

```
ip link set dev eth2 up
```
We use this line to create the port eth2 in the router-1. For each port the router is link to a different Subnet.

```
ip add add 192.168.173.1/30 dev eth2
```
This line is used to add an IP address to the new port. The port eth2 has the IP 192.168.173.1.

```
ip link set eth2 up
```
We used this line to switch on and check the port eth2.

```
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
We add this line for enable the forwarding that redirects each packets to the correct port using the IP address.

```
sed -i "s/\(zebra *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
sed -i "s/\(ospfd *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
service frr restart
vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'router ospf' -c 'redistribute connected'  -c 'exit' -c 'interface eth2' -c 'ip ospf area 0.0.0.0' -c 'exit' -c 'exit' -c 'write'
```
These lines are used to configure in the right way the FRR and allow to link correctly the two router and consequently the different Subnet.

#### IP
Router-1 has an IP on port eth2 and it's 192.168.173.1. This IP is allowed from the configuration of our network, infact it's inside the address space 192.168.168.0/21. We can't use the first IP address of the Subnet (192.168.173.0) because it's reserved to address space.

### Router-2
We add the following lines to router-2.sh file that are necessary to link the two router:
```
apt-get install -y frr --assume-yes --force-yes
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip add add 192.168.173.2/30 dev eth2
ip link set eth2 up
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sed -i "s/\(zebra *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
sed -i "s/\(ospfd *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
service frr restart
vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'router ospf' -c 'redistribute connected'  -c 'exit' -c 'interface eth2' -c 'ip ospf area 0.0.0.0' -c 'exit' -c 'exit' -c 'write'
```

```
apt-get install -y frr --assume-yes --force-yes
```
We use this line to install correctly the FRRouting that, link in the Router-1, allow to link the two router.

```
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip add add 192.168.173.2/30 dev eth2
ip link set eth2 up
```
We need these line to create the port eth2 of router-2 and add its the address 192.168.173.2.

```
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
We used this line to enable the forwarding that is necessary to send each packet to the correct port.

```
sed -i "s/\(zebra *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
sed -i "s/\(ospfd *= *\). */\1yes/" /etc/frr/daemons
service frr restart
vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'router ospf' -c 'redistribute connected'  -c 'exit' -c 'interface eth2' -c 'ip ospf area 0.0.0.0' -c 'exit' -c 'exit' -c 'write'
```
We use these lines to configure the FRR for link correctly the two router and consequently the all the Network.

#### IP
The `router-2` has on port eth2 the IP 192.168.173.2. This is the last free address; this Subnet has 30 bits used for the net and only the last 2 for hosts. With two bits we have 4 different address, two of them are used for address space and broadcast and the other two are used for the routers. 


<a name="C"></a>
## Subnet C
We'll call Subnet C the part of the Network that link router-2 to host-2-c. Using this link and the previous ones we can satisfy the request to link host-1-a and host-1-b to host-2-c.

This subnet doesn't need serveral IP addresses, so we opt to use only 2 bits for the hosts and the other 30 for the net. We need all the 4 (2^2) IP address. The first, with the last two bits at zero, is for the address space and it's 192.168.172.228. We decided to use the second one 192.168.172.229 for port eth1 of host-2-c and the third one for the router-2, it's 192.168.172.230 on port eth1. So we left the last one, with two one at the end, for the broadcast address (192.168.172.231).

<a name="r2-c"></a>
### Router-2
In the Subnet B we have already explain the `router-2` codes. There we talked about OSPF protocol in depth. Now we well explain the code we use in order to set up the Subnet C.
```
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip add add 192.168.172.230/30 dev eth1
ip link set eth1 up
```
Initially we bring eht1 up. Then we assign an IPv4 address to the interface eht1. The third line activate the link.

#### IP
The `router-2` has on port eth1 the IP 192.168.172.230. This Subnet has 30 bits used for the net; as a result only the last 2 bits are dedicated to the host (2 addresses are taken from address space and broadcast).

<a name="h2c-c"></a>
### Host-2-c 
In the file `docker-2c.sh` you can find these commands:

```
ip link set dev eth1 up
```
We add this line to create the port eth1 in the host-2-c.
```
ip add add 192.168.172.229/30 dev eth1
```
We use this line to add an address to the port eth1; now we can use this port to link the host with other device to send and recive packet.

```
ip route add 192.168.168.0/21 via 192.168.172.230
```
This line is used to add the route that a packet has to do. It say that all the packet with address 192.168.168.0/21, so all the packets that have the same 21 bits of this address, have to be send on the link with router-2 at address 192.168.172.230.
#### IP
Host-2-c has an IP address on port eth1 linked to router-2. It's 192.168.172.229 and it's the first address free in the configuration of the first VLAN. We can use all the other address except the two of the system and the router's address for any other hosts (until 4 hosts). 
#### Docker
We need to set up the Docker repository.  As a precaution, we decided to uninstall older versions of Docker when they were present.
```
apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
apt-get update --assume-yes --force-yes
apt-get install apt-transport-https --assume-yes --force-yes
apt-get install ca-certificates --assume-yes --force-yes
apt-get install curl --assume-yes --force-yes
apt-get install software-properties-common --assume-yes --force-yes
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
```

Now we can install and update Docker from the repository.
```
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce --assume-yes --force-yes
```
The next step is to build a web page to serve on nginx: we'll create a custom index page for our website.
We create a new directory for our website content within our home directory, and move to it, by running the commands shown below. Then we use the text editor touch to create an HTML file.
```
mkdir -p ~/docker-nginx/html
cd ~/docker-nginx/html
touch index.html
```
First of all we cleaned the file and then we put the website's  html code into it.
```
truncate -s 0 index.html
echo " -----  " >> index.html
```
FInally we link the container to the local filesystem by creating a new Nginx container (our virtual machine will be located in port 80).
```
docker rm docker-nginx
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```
<a name="How"></a>
# How-to
<a name="Requirements"></a>
## Requirements
 - 10GB disk storage
 - 2GB free RAM
 - Virtualbox
 - Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com)
 - Internet
<a name="Display"></a>
## Display the website
 - Install Virtualbox and Vagrant
 - Clone this repository `git clone` https://github.com/mattybass/dncs-lab
 - You should be able to launch the lab from within the cloned repo folder.
```
cd dncs-lab
[~/dncs-lab] vagrant up --provision
```
Once you launch the vagrant script, it may take some minutes (this value depends on you PC power) for the entire topology to become available. Do not worry if during the configuration the display will show you some errors: they won't undermine the machines' functioning.
 Now you can verify the status of the 4 VMs using the command
 ```
 [dncs-lab]$ vagrant status      
 ```
 If everything goes weel the terminal will show you                                                                                                                                                          
 ```
Current machine states:

router-1                  running (virtualbox)
router-2                  running (virtualbox)
switch                    running (virtualbox)
host-1-a                  running (virtualbox)
host-1-b                  running (virtualbox)
host-2-c                  running (virtualbox)
 ```
The request is to reach a website hosted on `host-2-c` from any host configured and attached to `router-1` (`host-1-a` and `host-1-c`). So, once all the VMs are running you can log into `host-1-a` and `host-1-b` (you have to duplicate the terminal or to log into the hosts in two different times: if you want to exit from an host type `exit`) using these commands (in two different windows):
```
vagrant ssh host-1-a
```
```
vagrant ssh host-1-b
```
The terminal will show you in each case:
```
Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.16.0-55-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
Development Environment
```
Then get the root permission of the two terminals using the command
```
sudo su
```

In order to browse the website type the command
```
curl 192.168.172.229
```
The vagrant response is going to be:

```

 ### Router-1
Log into the router using 
```
vagrant ssh router-1
```
```
sudo su
```
In order to look if `router-1` is working you can ping (use the command `ping` followed by the IP-address of the host/router you want to check) any net device.

For example pinging the `host-1-b`
```
ping 192.168.171.225
```
 you are going to have a response like that
```

You can also check the routing table, which is configurend thanks to ospf routing protocol.
```
route -nve
```
```

### Switch
Log into the switch using 
```
vagrant ssh switch
```
```
sudo su
```
In order to show OpenFlow information on the switch (OpenFlow features and port descriptions) use the command
```ovs-vsctl show```
```
    Bridge switch
        Port "eth3"
            tag: 171
            Interface "eth3"
        Port switch
            Interface switch
                type: internal
        Port "eth1"
            Interface "eth1"
        Port "eth2"
            tag: 170
            Interface "eth2"
    ovs_version: "2.0.2"
```
We can see the ports' name and also if they are associated to a VLAN. `Eth1` is a trunk port: it's a link between `switch` and `router-1`. Otherwise `Eth2` and `Eth3` are access port: they take the packets they receive and retag them.

You can also execute the `ifconfig` command for controlling network interface.
